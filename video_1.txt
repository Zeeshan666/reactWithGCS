# What's React?

React is not a framework but a Javascript-based UI development library.
framework => extra strictness, library => little relaxed wrt to rules


why needed? easier to manage and build UI and ensures consistency

# Important
state => another name for variables (state managed by JS while UI managed by DOM)
react makes single page application --> no router { we manipulate with the help of react-router-dom}
react initially didn't have state management but used additional JS libraries like Redux.
